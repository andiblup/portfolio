## Projects

### <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/projects/project1/">Rainbow Snake</a>:

> **Python, Turtle @VS CODE**

Rainbow Snake was one of my very first projects ever. As I began learning to program with Python, I quickly stumbled upon libraries like Turtle and Pygame, and I started recreating small games. My first choice was Snake.<br>

---

#### <a href="https://github.com/andiblup/ping_pong_gone_wrong">Ping-Pong-Gone_Wrong</a>:

> **Python, Turtle @VS CODE**

My second project was going to be another classic game, but this time one that could be played by two people. The choice was definitely Pong. It was also the first time I realized how crucial the choice of technology could be for the course of a project. Most of these obstacles were overcome by turning a few critical bugs into features.

---

#### <a href="https://github.com/andiblup/csv_manip">Python Script for a csv formation</a>:

> **Python @VS CODE**

A script I wrote for a friend for CSV manipulation. It splits the data received from the server, initially separated by commas within a single column, into separate columns for easier editing in Excel. Additionally, there is a script to reformat these divided data back into a single column.

---

#### <a href="https://gitlab.com/andiblup/bad_ui">Bad UI/UX:</a>

> **HTML, CSS, JS @VS CODE**

As one of our initial tasks at CODERS.BAY Vienna, we were tasked with creating a website in 2 weeks using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, designed to make user interaction as challenging as possible. This project allowed us to freely explore working with vanilla JavaScript and express our creativity in a unique way.

---

#### <a href="https://gitlab.com/andiblup/vuecipes">Recipe Site</a>:

> **HTML, SCSS, JS, Vue3, Vuetify, npm @VS CODE**

For our first practical project with VUE.js 3, we were provided with a backend. This gave us the necessary technical resources to create a recipe web app. As our initial project with VUE.js 3, the primary goal was to independently dive into the Single Page Application framework and its documentation, going beyond the basics.

---

#### <a href="https://gitlab.com/andiblup/vueprojekt">Trello Replic</a>:

> **HTML, SCSS, JS, Vue3, Vuetify, npm @VS CODE**

For our 4-week final project in Web Frontend, I built a Trello replica. Similar to the previous project, we were provided with a backend, and the primary requirement was to use VUE.js 3. In this project, I focused extensively on UI and translating designs into reality.

---

#### <a href="https://gitlab.com/andiblup/fantasyquest">FantasyQuest: Worldwalker Battles</a>:

> **Android Application: Kotlin, Android Jetpack & Compose @Android Studio** <br><br>
> **Backend: Java, SpringBoot @Intellij Cummunity** <br><br>
> **Maps Service: Mapbox resp. OpenStreetMap** <br><br>
>**Hosting: Current: XAMPP Planned: Firebase** <br><br>
>**Config: Gradle, Maven** <br><br>
>**Projectmanagement: Jira**

As part of our final project in Android, Kotlin, we were tasked with creating an Android app that didn't exist in that form before. I chose to combine this project with our final project in Java Spring Boot. The idea behind the app was to create a combination of Pokémon Go, the original Pokémon games, and Final Fantasy 1, which was a challenging endeavor to accomplish in less than 5 weeks. Time and resource management played a crucial role, as did clear prioritization and agile work. To make the app achievable within 5 weeks, I had to omit features related to multiplayer, among other things. I also had to familiarize myself with tools like Mapbox and Android, as I had no prior experience with either.

Working with location data for the first time was the most challenging aspect for me. However, I am very pleased and proud of this project and its provisional completion, especially since it turned into an emotional journey and involved a lot of stress.

#### <a href="https://gitlab.com/Hinotori91/coderscape">Current Group Project Game</a>:

Codename: `Project Ananas`

> **Java, JMonkeyEngine, Gradle, Maven**<br>
> **@Intellij Community, JMonkeyEngineSDK**

Working together as a group of seven individuals, we are developing a 3D or puzzle-platformer 2-player co-op game. The Players must use their surroundings or abilities to navigate through levels and platforms to reach the goal. The objective is to capture a mobile cannon that continually moves to the next level, gradually unveiling more of the story behind why we are pursuing it and why the little 'Tourette' is running away. We are programming the entire project using the JMonkeyEngine and IntelliJ Community Edition, following agile development methodologies.
